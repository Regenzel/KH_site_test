    <h1>Kingdom Hearts IV</h1>
    <p>The next major release in the Kingdom Hearts saga is Kingdom Hearts IV, the long-awaited continuation of the core story. <br>
    This title was officially announced by Square Enix and is currently in active development as the next mainline entry
    following Kingdom Hearts III and Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory. <br> <br>
    Kingdom Hearts IV is expected to build on the series’ signature blend of action, story, and exploration, 
    introducing new environments and gameplay systems while continuing the adventure with familiar characters. <br><br>
    Exact details about the full story, platforms, and official release date have not yet been confirmed.
    Square Enix has reaffirmed its commitment to the project and continues to share occasional development updates,<br>
    although the studio has not provided a full release window at this time — meaning fans are waiting for further official announcements.</p>
